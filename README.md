# Community-Detection

This code get as an input a list of vertices numbers (Each line contains two vertecies numbers which represents an edge)
and finds out:

1. How many nodes and edges in the graph

2. How many connected components in the graph and How many nodes are in the largest connected
component?

3. How many communities are discovered after running clique percolation with with 4-cliques, and which nodes are their members.
